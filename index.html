        <h2 class="s_text1">HISTORICAL OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p class="s_text2">Novosibirsk, the third-largest city in Russia, was founded in 1893 as a transport hub on the Trans-Siberian Railway. Initially named Novonikolayevsk in honor of Tsar Nicholas II, the city rapidly grew due to its strategic location and the influx of settlers and industries. By the early 20th century, it had become a significant commercial center, boasting various educational, cultural, and industrial establishments.
            <br> <br>
            The city played a pivotal role during the Soviet era, particularly in World War II, when many factories and scientific institutions were relocated here from the western parts of the USSR. Post-war, Novosibirsk continued to expand, evolving into a major scientific and research hub with the establishment of Akademgorodok in the 1950s, the "Science City" that is home to numerous scientific and educational institutions.
            <br> <br>
            Today, Novosibirsk is not only a central point on the map of Russia but also a vibrant cultural and economic center, reflecting a rich history of growth and transformation.</p>
